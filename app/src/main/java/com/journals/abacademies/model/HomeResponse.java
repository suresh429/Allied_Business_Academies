The NJ and ML phylogenetic tree showed almost similar topology which suggested that H. nana human isolates of present study were closely related which means they came from the same origin, were more related to H. nana infecting human especially Latin America due to migration, differed notably from rodent isolates of previous studies which support that rodent to human is less likely to happen and were different from human isolate of Australia.
